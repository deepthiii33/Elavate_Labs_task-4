# ðŸ”’ UFW Firewall Testing Project

This project demonstrates firewall configuration and traffic filtering on **Kali Linux** using `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall). It includes real-time tests using Pythonâ€™s built-in HTTP server and Netcat.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives


- Understand how to view and manage firewall rules with UFW.
- Learn how to allow/deny ports and test their behavior.
- Use common tools like Python HTTP server and Netcat (`nc`) to simulate network traffic.
- Observe how loopback (`127.0.0.1`) and external IP traffic interact with firewall rules.


---

## ðŸ§ª What This Project Covers

- Enabling UFW and checking rule status
- Testing open ports (like 8080) with Pythonâ€™s HTTP server
- Denying traffic and confirming behavior
- Verifying allowed ports using Netcat for TCP communication
- Cleanup and restoring the original firewall state
